# Session handoff — read this first if you are picking up mid-stream

**Last updated: 2026-07-14.** Branch: **`feat/work-tiering-ci`** (branched off
`fix/production-claim-evidence`, which is open as **PR #100 → `dev`**).

If you are a fresh session (local, cloud, resumed, or scheduled) and Matt says "continue",
this is where you continue from. Do not re-derive it; do not re-audit what is already audited.

## ✓ LANDED (2026-07-15): F91 phase-2 completion — commit `284a532`

The question-router throw-and-forget loop is COMMITTED and VERIFIED. Do not redo it. Approved
plan was `~/.claude/plans/glittery-singing-pine.md`. Decisions (Matt, 2026-07-15), now recorded
as `kpred:decided` on `kb:qr-throw-forget`: transport = reuse n8n + pub-sub (later); reach =
subscribed + opt-in; answers = pending + provenance, always reviewed; RBAC = finish local loop
first, F84 later.

Verified before commit: `npm run check` 0 errors, `npx vitest run` 956 pass (31 router/reach/
verifiability), `npm run align` green, `graph-lint` 0 errors (the dead-link check correctly
flagged the two NEW files until they were staged — it is git-aware). Roadmap updated in the same
commit: `kb:qr-throw-forget` scaffolded → **functional**, `kb:question-router` planned →
**in-progress**, both with honest-notes scoping the claim to the LOCAL loop.

**Still TODO (NOT done — genuinely remaining, honest scope):**
- **The "ask another graph" review-UI entry** (plan task #17). Phase-1 `remaining` also names
  this ("expose in review/reckoning UI as 'ask another graph'"). No UI yet exposes routing OR
  the opt-in consent marker — the marker is honoured but there is no way to SET it in-app.
- **Real cross-boundary transport.** Today one process's pending queue stands in for two graphs.
  n8n + pub-sub is the decided direction (later).
- **Phase 3 RBAC daisy-chain** (`kb:qr-rbac-chain`) — gated on F84.

Branch is **PR #101 → dev**. Push the commit; do not merge to `main`.

## AWAKEN OPUS TO ORCHESTRATE (Matt asked, session-limit)

On resume (unsnooze fires on limit-reset), after committing the above and draining the free
queue: **run `npm run orchestrate`** — triage the pending queue (re-derivable / remediable /
judgment), promote worthwhile drafts into `tasks.ttl`, and work the judgment residue. That is the
Opus-tier orchestration Matt wants resumed. The 13 standing offline jobs drain for free via the
runner before you spend a token.

## Recently landed (do not redo)

- **Dichotomy detection** (`src/lib/rdf/dichotomy.ts`) — one entity, two truths; CONFLICT
  (single-valued, one is wrong) vs natural DICHOTOMY (multi-valued, preserve). Filter beside
  hubs/islands, conflict count ⚠ on the chip. The stranded batch from the Bash outage is committed.
- **F91 question router phase 1** (`src/lib/rdf/question-router.ts`) — ranks which graph could
  answer a question by relatedness (knows-the-subject > predicate > neighbourhood overlap);
  `addressees()` thresholds so it routes, not broadcasts. Phases 2 (throw-and-forget across the
  F80 answer loop) and 3 (RBAC daisy-chain, per-hop provenance, gated on F84) are `planned`.
- **13 standing offline jobs** in `reckons-workspace/tasks.ttl` (evidence, safety, tests,
  reconcile, orchestrate, tokens, competitor discovery, deep visual testing). They drain via the
  `drain-queue` schedule → runner. NOTE the runner has slow tasks (test suites, build+serve smoke)
  so a full `npm run agent:run` can take minutes — fine for the autonomous runner, run with a
  generous timeout interactively or `--once`.
- **Ideas graph** (`reckons-workspace/ideas.ttl`) holds Matt's idea waves: meta-graph flows
  (feedback graph → roadmap, user-defined graph-to-graph flows, subscriber graphs, live-nodes
  auto-e2e), gamified full-screen review (dichotomy + Blender), story-mode-in-review. **These
  want to become roadmap FEATURES — promoting them is a user-authority act; ask Matt or leave staged.**

## Do this now — SPEND NO TOKENS BEFORE YOU HAVE TO

1. `git fetch && git checkout feat/work-tiering-ci` (open as **PR #101 → `dev`**)
2. **`npm run agent:run`** — drains the script-tier task queue (`reckons-workspace/tasks.ttl`).
   Deterministic, **zero tokens**. It writes its outcomes INTO the graph, so read
   `reckons-workspace/tasks.state.ttl` to see what it actually did. A task reported as
   `WAITING` is asking Matt something — leave it; it resumes by itself when he answers.
3. `npm run offline:script-tier` — the free checks (~40s, zero tokens).
4. `npm run align` — must be green. It **blocks CI**.
5. Only now start reasoning. Work the **Next up** list below, in order.

Everything under **Done** is committed and pushed. Do not redo it.

## The whole point of this session, in one line

**Route every task to the cheapest tier that can do it correctly** (script → local agent →
Opus). If you catch yourself doing what a script could do, stop and write the script — that
IS the work. And if you meet an ambiguity: **ASK** (`scripts/agent/ask.ts`), never guess. A
guess silently entered into a knowledge graph is worse than a stalled task — it is a lie the
graph will repeat in Matt's name.

## Read the mission first: `kb:mission` + `kb:thesis` in the roadmap graph

It is never about the tool. The knowledge needed to DECIDE is usually a few team members
away — a DISTANCE problem, not an information problem. A document records conclusions, not
the structure that produced them; two documents cannot be diffed for reasoning, two graphs
can.

**The thesis:** *an unverifiable claim, made by the party it benefits, is not evidence.*
Arrived at three separate times from three unrelated directions (a stated purpose does not
unlock a gate; a weak similarity does not justify a link; a source you control yourself is
not a source), which is why it is the thesis and not a rule.

**The invention is not what the graph stores — it is that the graph can hold the SHAPE OF
WHAT IS MISSING.** A partial fact (subject + predicate known, object `?`, plus what it
blocks) is the most useful node in the graph. You cannot ask a question you have not
discovered you have. This is why F80 (agents ask the graph, not the human) matters more
than it looks: it is the mission, not a workflow convenience.

## The theme of this session

**Token discipline (F74.3 work tiering).** Route every recurring task to the cheapest tier
that can do it correctly: script → local agent → Opus. Opus is for orchestration, hard
judgment, and code that lands. If you catch yourself doing what a script could do, stop and
write the script — that IS the work.

## Done (committed AND pushed — PR #101 → dev). Do not redo.

**The orchestration loop now closes end to end.** That is the headline; everything else served it.
The whole pipeline is: `npm run schedule` (reads schedules from TTL) → `reconcile` (drop resolved
findings) → `runner` (drain tasks, script + local-agent) → `orchestrate` (triage the residue for
Opus). Every stage reads and writes the graph; none of it costs a cloud token except the Opus
triage at the very end.

- **The task queue is a graph.** `src/lib/rdf/agent-task.ts` + `scripts/agent/runner.ts`.
  `npm run agent:run` drains `reckons-workspace/tasks.ttl`: claim (a LEASE, not a lock) →
  execute → **verify INDEPENDENTLY** → write the outcome back. A task with no `done-when` is
  REFUSED ("a wish, not a task"). Handles `script` AND `local-agent` tiers; a local-agent task
  with Ollama down WAITS (not fails). A recurring task (`kpred:every "7d"`) is never *done*, it
  is *due again*. An expired lease with no outcome is detected and requeued.
- **Schedules live in the graph** (`scripts/agent/schedule.ts`, `reckons-workspace/schedules.ttl`).
  `npm run schedule` reports what is due and runs it; the trigger (cron/systemd/unsnooze/human)
  reads the graph, not a crontab. Intervals, not cron — drain, do not schedule.
- **The orchestrator** (`npm run orchestrate`) splits the pending queue into RE-DERIVABLE (a
  script regenerates it — fix the source), REMEDIABLE (draft one task for the cluster), and
  JUDGMENT (Opus/Matt). Drafts are proposals, never auto-queued. Opus is the judgment tier and
  cannot be a script — this is the harness it runs inside.
- **`npm run reconcile`** drops queued findings whose deterministic check no longer fires. The
  queue was 18% ghosts (resolved graph-lint findings lingering); now 139 and every item is open.
- **A task can ASK instead of guessing.** It emits a partial fact naming what it needs and
  what it blocks, exits `42`, and the runner marks it **WAITING** — not done, not failed. It
  resumes by itself when Matt answers, in the review queue *or* via Shelly (both resolve the
  same fact). `MAX_ATTEMPTS` bounds it: patience is not infinite retry of a broken thing.
- **`kb_merge` MCP tool** — an orchestrator can now merge a sub-agent's graph. Proposals only;
  CONFLICTS sort first. Found 23 real ones on its first run (the roadmap thinks the MCP server
  has 10 tools; production says 20).
- **F88 verifiability axis** — `verifiable-by` (code|test|source|user|unknown) decides WHO may
  approve a fact. Code/tests never reach Matt. **Authority overrides verifiability**: roadmap
  and principles are his however checkable they are. Unclassified fails toward the human.
- **Review queue routes by gate**, ranked by TRANSITIVE blast radius. Defaults to "yours".
- **`npm run align` BLOCKS in CI** — the graph→site generators all had `--check` modes and none
  gated anything. `landing-features.ts` was HARD BROKEN (it could not regenerate at all).
- **Script tier BLOCKS in CI** (`--ci`). Docs generated from the graph (`docs-coding-workflow`).
  `claim-audit` sweeps hand-written copy for claims the graph denies. SRI on the Sveltia bundle.
  Both dependabot alerts closed. Filters ghost instead of deleting. CUDA repaired; Ollama 100% GPU.

## Next up (in priority order)

The orchestration loop is BUILT (schedule → reconcile → runner → orchestrate). What remains is
using it and extending it.

1. **Triage RAN (2026-07-15).** `npm run orchestrate` on a 186-item queue: **14 re-derivable**
   (all `graph-lint/predicate-economy` — a standing design nudge that fires every run; reconcile
   will NOT clear it, only naming real relations in the TTL or accepting it will), **0 remediable**,
   **172 judgment**. The judgment residue is dominated by MATT-authority / route-to-a-human
   clusters, not Opus grind: 54 branch-align/suggestion, 24 history-lessons/fix-without-test (a
   test-writing backlog — judgment which to write), 16 branch-align/status-update, 16
   claude-code/observation, 14 competitor-scan/candidate (his rule: the *judgment* stays human),
   12 alignment-sweep/question, plus smaller question clusters agents threw (runner/1,
   code-review/2, button-crawl/2, claude-code/8). **Not grinding these autonomously was deliberate:**
   a wrong answer written to the graph is a lie it repeats in Matt's name, and most of this queue
   is explicitly his. Next Opus pass: pick the small QUESTION clusters you can answer with
   certainty (they feed the F91 answer-loop), and propose graph edits for the predicate-economy 14.
   Also landed this session: `fix(runner)` Ollama-URL propagation (3893f05), competitor-scan
   honest-status declaration (aae682b).
   **The small QUESTION clusters are now RESOLVED (2026-07-15, commits ac3bdaa + 72f5a33):**
   answered the code-verified ones (runner = node process; `g` = source/provenance), rejected 3
   verified-false findings (2 local code-review false positives + the button-crawl "bookmarked(0)"
   which is correctly disabled at 0), and recorded Matt's design calls in the graph — a single
   MERGE BAND (auto >=0.90 / suggest 0.50-0.90 / below 0.50 nothing) now governs entity merge,
   predicate-sameness AND linking (superseded the 2026-07-13 ~0.80 link floor — conflict surfaced,
   not overwritten); PWA orientation portrait->any (+F34 must test both orientations); TTL/TriG
   split by USE (private export = TTL no publisher; publishing = TriG + owner/publisher REQUIRED).
   All `planned`/spec, marked not-yet-wired. What remains is the BIG judgment clusters
   (history-lessons 31, competitor-scan 18, graph-lint 14, alignment-sweep 12) — mostly Matt's.

   **AUTONOMOUS STRETCH (2026-07-15, "work unblocked roadmap by priority") — 4 features advanced,
   all with tested pure cores + honest status, forming one coherent REVIEW-AT-SCALE system:**
   - **F80.1 auto-merge** planned→scaffolded (3ee1cc6, 371b3f1): `merge-band.ts` (the one
     executable copy of the 0.9/0.5 band) + `pending-dedup.ts` (fold exact-dupe pending facts;
     semantic suggest tier injected) + wired into `drainAndImportPending` (within-batch, complete
     facts only — partials left alone so blocks/question isn't dropped).
   - **F52 control-model** planned→scaffolded (e977314): `agent-edit-boundary.ts` — the wall.
     `gateFactWrite` downgrades any agent attempt to settle a fact to a proposal; enforced via
     `addStatements({origin:'agent'})` on the drain path. Composes with F88.
   - **F53 review-attention** planned→scaffolded (5f3513a): `review-attention.ts` —
     `spotlightUserQueue` splits the F88 user lane into a capped spotlight (conflicts + decisions)
     and a quiet flow; over-cap contested items HELD BACK, never quieted.
   - **F83 graph-legibility** (in-progress, 156a17a): `entity-review.ts` — `groupPendingByEntity`
     condenses 1888 triple-rows to ~233 entity cards, each carrying its strongest F88 gate.
   These four COMPOSE: dedup removes noise → the wall ensures proposals → entity-review condenses
   to cards → attention spotlights the contested. NONE are wired into the review UI yet (that is
   the functional step, and it needs browser verification this headless env can't give) — the
   next session's highest-leverage move is wiring them into the Review surface and watching it
   render. 997 tests pass; align green; all on PR #101.
2. **F90 Blender** (planned) — headless Blender over MCP. The trap is in the roadmap:
   **Blender renders a black frame and exits 0.** First domain where `done-when` cannot be a
   passing test — exactly what F88's `verifiable-by` exists for (deterministic image check →
   VLM proposal → user, in that order).
3. **Wire the review queue's gate routing to F88's authority rules end-to-end** — the routing
   is built (`review-routing.ts`) and defaults to "yours"; confirm the UI honours it against a
   real pending queue (I unit-tested it but did not watch it render loaded).
4. **F27 / F34 / F79 / F83** — still `in-progress`/`scaffolded`. `npm run brief` reads their real
   status from the graph.

## The pattern that ran through this whole session (read before you trust a check)

Nearly every bug this session was a CHECK THAT WAS CONFIDENTLY WRONG — and I made the mistake
myself repeatedly, hours apart: `published-graph-guard` banned the product's own vocabulary;
`graph-lint` counted errors it refused to print, missed conflicting statuses, and asked "is this
on my disk" instead of "is this in the repo"; the digest generator was non-deterministic; the
reconciler read the wrong JSON key and nearly deleted live findings. **Determinism buys "the rule
fired", never "the rule was right."** Test the checker against a known-bad input before trusting
it — every one of these was caught only by doing that, and shipped only when I didn't.

## Decisions that are MATT'S, not yours

- **`kb:adopt-user-owned-sync`** — the biggest finding of the competitive scan. SiYuan (45k
  stars) ships **self-hosted** sync and stays privacy-first; RxDB (Apache-2.0) replicates to
  a backend the *user* supplies. We wrote "no sync" when we meant "no sync **through us**".
  `kb:avoid-hosted-sync` now scopes itself to the OPERATOR. Whether to build user-owned sync
  is Matt's call. Do not decide it for him.
- **`kb:adopt-sonnet-bucket`** — F74.3 treats "Opus" as one rung when it is three. Anthropic's
  own benchmarks put an orchestrator + Sonnet workers at 96% of quality for 46% of cost, and
  subscriptions carry an *additional* Sonnet-only weekly bucket. Our ladder has no account of
  cloud-to-cloud tiering. Whether to restructure it is Matt's call.
- **Third-party plug-in boundary.** Matt's rule (2026-07-14): sideload separate projects where
  complexity is high and the license allows; **never for core-critical features**; the user
  must confirm they understand the code is not controlled by Reckons.AI. Sveltia is the
  existing precedent (below). Not yet written into the roadmap TTL — do that before building.

## Known-bad, already recorded — do not "discover" this again

- **RESOLVED — and it was never true.** An earlier entry here said the published graph
  (`static/knowledge.ttl`) carried "166 test-harness terms". **That finding was false.**
  `published-graph-guard` banned `urn:reckons:story/`, which is the PRODUCT'S OWN guided-story
  vocabulary (`src/lib/rdf/story.ts`; used by the landing page and TurtleChatPanel; declared in
  `reckons-production.ttl`). The real harness namespace is `urn:reckons:test/` and it appears
  **zero** times. The graph was clean all along. The guard is fixed, the stale header count was
  a real finding and is fixed (1032 → 3096), and **the CI script tier is now BLOCKING** (`--ci`).
  Do not "rediscover" the debris — there is none.
- **The force simulation never converges.** Nodes drift continuously — a control run with no
  filter touched showed 234/336 nodes moving >12px in 2.5s. Do NOT write position-invariance
  tests; they measure noise and will fail whether or not the code is right. See the comment
  in `tests/visual/user-stories/filter-ghosting.test.ts`.
- **111 pending facts** are queued in `reckons-workspace/knowledge.pending.jsonl` awaiting
  triage in the Review tab. Triaging that queue is Opus tier-3 work — filling it is what the
  other two tiers are for.

## How third-party code is plugged in (the Sveltia precedent)

Matt asked "how is this done anyway?" — the answer, for whoever extends it:

`static/admin/index.html` is a **standalone HTML document** served at `/admin`, *outside* the
SvelteKit app shell. It loads `@sveltia/cms` from a **version-pinned CDN URL with an SRI
hash**, is **not an npm dependency**, and is **not vendored or forked**. The app never
imports a line of its code.

The integration contract is **a file format** — markdown + frontmatter in `content/` — **not
a code API**. That is what makes it safe to plug in: if `/admin` vanishes, the app is
unaffected, because the graph is the source of truth and Sveltia is only an optional editor
over generated markdown.

Rules for the next one:
- License must allow it (`kpred:copy-permitted`; `competitor-scan.ts` enforces this).
- **Never for core-critical features.**
- The user confirms they understand the code is not controlled by Reckons.AI.
- Pin the version AND an SRI hash computed from the **npm tarball**, never from the CDN
  alone — hashing whatever the CDN hands you faithfully pins an attacker's bytes.

## unsnooze (auto-resume) — ARMED as of 2026-07-14

`saaranshM/unsnooze` (MIT, license verified) auto-resumes a session that stopped on a usage
limit. It is installed and the revival path is live:

- unsnooze 1.10.0, global npm install
- `StopFailure` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` (backup: `settings.json.unsnooze-bak`)
- shell wrappers for `claude`/`codex` in `~/.bashrc`
- daemon running; `tmux 3.4` present, so there is a pane to revive INTO
- `resumeMessages.claude` points a woken session at **this file**, then
  `npm run offline:script-tier`, then the Next-up list, and restates the CLAUDE.md rules
  (graphs are the plan; PRs target `dev`, never `main`; cheapest tier first)

**The one thing NOT verified:** whether the hook applies to a session that was ALREADY
RUNNING when the hook was installed. It was installed mid-session on 2026-07-14, and Claude
Code may only read hooks at session start. Sessions started afterwards are definitely
covered. Do not assume the auto-resume caught a session — check `unsnooze status`.

**This file remains the real continuation mechanism.** It needs no daemon, no hook, and no
multiplexer, and it works when unsnooze does not.

### Environment note — the CUDA repair (2026-07-14)

`apt` was wedged and could install nothing (tmux included). Cause: NVIDIA's CUDA 13.1 debs
changed `/usr/local/cuda-13.1/lib64` and `/include` from real DIRECTORIES into SYMLINKS
(`-> targets/x86_64-linux/…`), and dpkg refuses to let one package replace a directory another
package claims with a symlink. A packaging-transition bug, not local corruption.

Fixed with `sudo apt -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" --fix-broken install -y`, which is
safe here because every conflicting package belongs to the same CUDA toolkit and the conflict
was only in dpkg's ownership database. Toolkit restored (`nvcc` works, symlinks in place), zero
packages left in `iU`. The GPU driver was never involved — both RTX 3090s and Ollama stayed up
throughout. If `apt` wedges this way again, this is the fix.
